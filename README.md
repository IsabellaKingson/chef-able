## Installation

We used the tools that we had on our computer, like Git, Vscode, Github, and Google. First, we cloned the repo into our local file, made a GitHub repo, and named both the local and global repo. We opened the file in our VScode and started coding the project, and used Chrome developer tools to live to check the website for errors and stuff. Then we push it into our GitHub for deployment. We also use a CSS framework called Materalized and 2 API for the our recipe and planner portion of the app.
